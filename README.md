# PZ41-Sandbox-file-with-descriptions
The main point of this repo is to provide useful descriptive comments in Project Zomboid's sandbox file.

For singleplayer on Windows:
Download or copy the PZ41_SP_in_game_order.cfg
Place or paste into C:\Users\USERNAME\Zomboid\Sandbox Presets

For multiplayer on Windows:
Download or copy the PZ41_MP_SandboxVars.lua
Place or paste into C:\Users\USERNAME\Zomboid\Server

Both singleplayer and multiplayer files contain Project Zomboid's default values for the Apocalypse setting.
I have re-ordered the file's settings to match the order you see when editing the in-game sandbox settings.
I have provided comments that describe the minimum and maximum values for most drop downs in those settings.
As best as I could, I attempted to match up the names of each option between the CFG file and the in-game sandbox settings.

As far as I am able to tell these options seem to be unused:
WaterShutModifier=14
ElecShutModifier=14
ZombieLore.Smell=2
